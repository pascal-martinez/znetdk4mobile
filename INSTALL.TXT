ZnetDK installation procedure
-----------------------------
To install ZnetDK for the first time, just copy the 'znetdk' directory into your
web publication directory ('www/', 'localweb/', 'htdocs' according you WAMP, LAMP
or MAMP distribution), then launch the Application Wizard to generate your first
application, entering the 'http://127.0.0.1/znetdk?tool=appwiz' URL into the
address bar of your web browser.

If you already installed a previous version of ZnetDK:
1. First, backup the 'znetdk/applications' directory containing the
   applications you've already developed. Optionnaly, backup your 
   'znetdk/.htaccess' file if you've customized the one shipped with a previous
   version of ZnetDK.
2. Next, install ZnetDK in a new empty directory or in your original ZnetDK
   directory after having removing all existing files and directories.
3. Restore your original 'znetdk/applications' directory and the 
   'znetdk/.htaccess' file in the new installed directory.
4. Finally, read the CHANGELOG.TXT file to apply the changes required for
   ensuring compatibility with your application developed in a previous version.
