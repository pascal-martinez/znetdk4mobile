ZnetDK 2.8.0, 2022-12-12
------------------------
- CHANGE (all): class names now conform to the PSR-4 autoloading standard. This
  means that a PHP script named MyClass.php corresponding to the definition of
  MyClass is now loaded automatically. In the previous version of ZnetDK, the
  same PHP script had to be named myclass.php to be automatically loaded.

- CHANGE (all): calling a web service with http GET method is now accepted when
  the corresponding controller and action are authorized by setting the
  CFG_ACTIONS_ALLOWED_FOR_WEBSERVICE_USERS parameter. In previous version, only
  controller's actions named 'download' could be called with the http GET
  method. This possibility can be particularly useful when a controller action
  is to be executed from a webcron service.
- CHANGE (all): new optional parameter '$sanitize' added to the
  \UserSession::setCustomValue() and \UserSession::getCustomValue() methods.
  When this parameter is set to TRUE (FALSE by default), the custom value is
  sanitized before being stored in user session or returned from user session.
- CHANGE (all): \General::isPictureTooBig() private method is converted to a
  public method to check if a photo is too big to be reduced in regards of
  the available memory in the PHP process. Initially only called by the
  \General::reducePictureSize() method to avoid memory allocation error,
  \General::isPictureTooBig(), now can be called with a custom $tweakFactor
  value (set by defaut to 1.65 in previous version of ZnetDK, this value has
  been increased to 2) before reducing a photo.
- CHANGE (all): \General::reducePictureSize() method no longer returns FALSE on
  error. Instead, a ZDKException is thrown ('GEN-003' to 'GEN-006').
- CHANGE (all): new $tweakFactor parameter (set to 2 by default) added to the
  \General::reducePictureSize() method.
- CHANGE (all): new CFG_IS_IN_MAINTENANCE parameter to close access to the

  overloaded in the 'locale.php' script of the application to customize the
  message.
- CHANGE (all): the date format set through the LC_LOCALE_DATE_FORMAT must now

- CHANGE (all): Http request data filtering can be globally disabled by setting
  'NONE' to the CFG_REQUEST_VARIABLE_FILTERING_LEVEL parameter. In addition,
  the \Request::setVariableFilteringLevel() method accepts the value 'NONE' as
  parameter to disable value filtering for a specific Http request only.
- CHANGE (all): \Request::setTrimedCharacters() method now returns a boolean
  value. If the '$trimedCharacters' parameter is not NULL or is not a string
  then a FALSE value is returned.
- CHANGE (all): controller\Users::notify() method removed as it was not useful.
- CHANGE (ZnetDK 4 mobile only): new znetdkMobile.list.loadedCallback property to

  data page number loaded.
- CHANGE (ZnetDK 4 mobile only): new znetdkMobile.list.afterInsertRowCallback
  property to define a custom function to call after a row has been inserted in
  a list. This function has one parameter which contains the new inserted list
  item as a jQuery element. This callback function can be useful for example to
  set draggable the list item once added to the list.

  space between the top of the view container and the top of the page change,
  for example when the secondary menu is shown on multiple lines, when a

  now forced to true.
- BUG FIXING (all): in PHP 8.1, error "E_DEPRECATED - Function strftime() is
  deprecated - engine\core\convert.php(116)".

  znetdkMobile.install.showUninstallView().
- CHANGE (ZnetDK 4 mobile only): new CFG_MOBILE_INSTALL_MESSAGE_DISPLAY_AUTO
  parameter to enable or disable automatic display of a message to install the

  in memory to reduce network traffic. To enable caching, set a value greater
  than zero (set to zero by default) to the 'maxNumberOfCachedItems' widget's
  option or to the 'data-zdk-maxcacheditems' HTML input's attribute. To clear
  the cache once a suggestion is selected, set the value 'selection' to the

  property to define a custom function to call each time a row is inserted in a
  list. This function has one parameter which contains the data to display for

  leaves the application).
- BUG FIXING (all): when calling the DAO::store() method with an empty row id

  replaced by fontawesome icons.
- CHANGE: when the column resizing feature is enabled for the zdkdatatable
  widget ('resizableColumns' widget option), the width of each column when it is
  resized, is memorized by the web browser. So, the columns are automatically

  returned as an array by the 'setAsynchronousActions()' protected method of
  the application or module controller (derived from \AppController).
  In addition, the new CFG_ASYNCEXEC_PHP_BINARY_PATH parameter is to customize
  according to the Operating System where the web application is
  deployed (see 'engine/core/config.php' inline comments for details). Finally,
  the asynchronous process execution is traced into the 'engine/log/system.log'
  file when the CFG_ASYNCEXEC_LOG_ENABLED parameter is set to TRUE.
- BUG FIXING: the dialog content height was not adjusted automatically according
  to the wiewport height on ZnetDK dialogs with the 'autoHeight' option enabled.

  https://user:pwd@mydomain.com/?control=myctrl&action=dostuff.
  The specified credentials must match an existing user otherwise a 401 HTTP
  error is returned and an error message is added to the ZnetDK errors.log file.
  For security purpose, the CFG_ACTIONS_ALLOWED_FOR_WEBSERVICE_USERS parameter
  must be defined for limiting the controller action that a user can execute
  when it is authenticated by the basic authentication method. For example:
  define('CFG_ACTIONS_ALLOWED_FOR_WEBSERVICE_USERS',serialize(array(
         'user1|controller1:doaction1', 'user2|controller2:doaction2')));
- CHANGE: refresh button added to the 'users' view for updating the datatable

- CHANGE: the authentication 'Profiles' datatable is enhanced by the display of
  tooltips on the 'Profile' and 'Description' columns and the capability of
  resizing the column width.
- CHANGE: the authentication 'Users' view is enhanced with a new search field
  for searching users by their name, login and assigned profile name.
  In addition, the user datatable can be paginated to display only 10, 20 or 100
  rows. Finally, the 'Profiles' column content is now multi-lines for a better
  readability of the profiles assigned to a user when they are numerous.
- CHANGE: new 'resetSortLabel' option and 'data-zdk-resetsortlabel' HTML
  attribute added to the 'zdkdatatable' widget for adding a button on the
  datatable header when a sortable column is clicked. The button label is the
  one specified for the new option or attribute. The LC_BTN_RESET_SORT PHP
  constant can be used for labelizing this button. When clicking on this new
  button, the datatable rows are sorted applying the default sort order applied
  before having clicked on a datatable column.
- CHANGE: the user panel displayed when clicking on the login name from the
  application banner is enlarged for best display of long user email addresses.
- CHANGE: new 'setReadOnly(readOnly)' method added to the ZnetDK Form widget for
  enabling or disabling the user keyboard entry of the input elements located
  within the data form.
- CHANGE: the icons' buttons displayed on the user confirmation dialog when
  calling the znetdk.getUserConfirmation() javascript method, are replaced by
  Fontawesome icons.
- CHANGE: the attribute 'autocomplete' is set to 'off' when instantiating a
  ZnetDK InputDate widget for avoiding the display of some date suggestions by
  the web browser over the jQuery UI Datepicker calendar.
- CHANGE: a fontawesome icon now can be set to the Dialog widget title bar (on
  the left of the dialog title text) by setting the 'data-icon' attribute to the
  the dialog div element.
- CHANGE: when the application is configured with the CFG_PAGE_LAYOUT parameter
  set tot 'office', the fontawesome icon defined for the navigation menu item is
  now also displayed on the dialog title bar of the corresponding view.

  menu are enlarged (class 'fa-lg' set to the icon and 15px font size set to the
  label).
- CHANGE: the red warning icon displayed when an error is displayed into a
  ZnetDK form widget is replaced by a fontawesome icon.
- CHANGE: when the application is configured with the CFG_PAGE_LAYOUT parameter
  set tot 'office', the height of the dialog containing the view is fixed to the
  maximum height of the client area if any HTML element within the wiew has the
 'zdk-view-maxheight' CSS class.
- CHANGE: new 'zdk-modal-maximizable' CSS class allowing to set a ZnetDK modal
  dialog as maximizable. When the modal dialog is set maximizable, its maximized
  state is memorized into the web browser local storage and its content is
  scollable in case of overflow.
- CHANGE: new getRowData() public method added to the ZnetDK datatable widget
  for retrieving the internal data of the specified datatable row element.
- CHANGE: styling classes are added to each cell of the header and body ZnetDK
  datatable widget rows with the 'zdk-col-' prefix followed by the 'field' value
  set for the columns definition. By this way, the column styling is simplified
  for setting the alignment and the width.
- CHANGE: the dialog displayed when calling the znetdk.getUserConfirmation()
  method is no longer closable otherwise than by clicking on the yes or no
  button.
- CHANGE: new ZnetDK Fullscreen widget allowing to display in full screen a

  according to the specified sort criteria.
- CHANGE: new 'data-zdk-autowidth' HTML attribute and 'autoWidth' option added
  to the ZnetDK autocomplete widget for setting the suggestion panel width
  according to its content width.
- CHANGE: now the \Request::getRemoteAddress() method returns the user IP
  address reading first the 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' server parameter for taking
  in account the case of users connected through a proxy server. If the
  'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR' is not set, the 'REMOTE_ADDR' server parameter is used
  instead.
- CHANGE: new ZnetDK Picklist widget based on the PrimeUI Picklist widget.
  The picklist is automatically instantiated when declared within a ZnetDK form
  with the 'zdk-picklist' CSS class. The 'data-zdk-action' HTML5 attribute set
  for the picklist DIV element allows to load the source and target lists from
  the remote PHP controller action.
- CHANGE: new 'getInputValues' method added to the ZnetDK form for retrieving
  the value(s) of the specified input name.
- CHANGE: the DAO::$tableAlias property is now automatically applied to the
  SQL DELETE statement generated by the DAO::remove method when the table alias
  prefixes a column name in the DAO::$filterClause property while multiple rows
  are to be removed (the $rowID parameter is set to NULL when calling the
  DAO::remove method).
- BUG FIXING: the server name into the application URI returned by a call to the
  General::getApplicationURI() method was empty on some hosting system.
- BUG FIXING: when a ZnetDK modal dialog was declared with the
  'confirmationOnClose' option that contained more than one data form, the
  confirmation message when exiting the dialog without saving was not displayed
  while the data had been modified into the second or following data form.
- BUG FIXING: the edit dialog was displayed when double-clicking on a datatable
  row while the edit button was not declared within the ZnetDK action bar.
- BUG FIXING: the URL rewriting mechanism enabled when the CFG_VIEW_PAGE_RELOAD
  parameter is set to TRUE, did not work on some hosting system by reading the
  REDIRECT_URL server variable. So, the HTTP request original URL is now
  retrieved from the REQUEST_URI server variable that works generally for all
  hosting systems.

ZnetDK 1.8, 2017-12-15
----------------------
- CHANGE: new 'silent' parameter added to the 'uncheck' method of the PrimeUI
  Checkbox widget for disabling the 'change' events triggering when it is set
  to true.
- CHANGE: new CFG_SQL_PORT parameter for setting the port number where the MySQL
  database server is listening.
- CHANGE: new CFG_SEARCH_ENGINES_INDEXING_ENABLED parameter for preventing the
  indexing and listing of a ZnetDK application by the web search engines.
- CHANGE: the DAO::$result property declaration is changed from 'private' to
  'protected' for giving access to the derived classes.
- CHANGE: the 'fieldValueTriggered' column property of the ZnetDK datatable
  widget is no longer mandatory. So, the 'icon' column property can be set
  alone for display purpose only.
- CHANGE: the ZnetDK form widget displays now the multiple messages returned
  by the controller action called on submit. The multiples messages must be
  returned in the AJAX response within the 'multi-messages' property as an array
  of JavaScript objects mathing to 'znetdk.multiMessages()' method's parameters.
- CHANGE: the ZnetDK standard button icons are replaced by the FontAwesome
  icons.
- CHANGE: when calling the 'showCustomError' zdkform method with an empty
  message while an error message is displayed, the currently displayed error
  message is hidden.
- CHANGE: new Font Awesome 'key' icon displayed on the change password button
  when clicking on the user login name from the application banner.
- BUG FIXING: when a ZnetDK form widget contained a PrimeUI checkbox widget,
  the form state was wrongly set to 'modified' after the call of the form 'init'
  method.
- BUG FIXING: the horizontal scroll bar is forced to hidden for textarea widget.
- BUG FIXING: the 'modified' state of the ZnetDK form widget was not updated
  after radio button selection changes.
- BUG FIXING: the panel of the Autocomplete widget could be displayed out of the
  screen view port.
- BUG FIXING: the \Request::getRemoteAddress() method could return a NULL value
  on some hosting servers.
- BUG FIXING: error message "cannot call methods on zdkmodal prior to
  initialization; attempted to call method 'show'" displayed when calling the
  znetdk.showModalDialog while only one HTML form element exists in the DOM
  after loading the view.
- BUG FIXING: the PrimeUI notify widget used to display critical error messages
  can now display long messages without they being truncated.
- BUG FIXING: the dialog widget was positioned out of the viewport in the case
  of a document overflow while it was declared with the 'autoheight' attribute.
- BUG FIXING: after disabling and enabling the PrimeUI Dropdown widget, the
  selection of the next or previous element with the arrow keys did not work
  properly.

ZnetDK 1.7, 2017-05-20
----------------------
- CHANGE: the 'crypt' PHP function is no longer called for hashing and verifying
  the user passwords. It is replaced by a call to the 'password_hash' and the
  'password_verify' functions for compatibility purpose with PHP 5.6 and higher.
  The 'login_password' column size is enlarged to 255 characters in the
  'zdk_users' SQL table when it is generated for a new application using the
  Application Wizard.
- CHANGE: the fontawesome icons are updated to the version 4.7.
- CHANGE: new UserManager::getUserInfosById method allowing to select the user
  informations from her or his database identifier.
- CHANGE: new UserManager::getUserInfosByName method allowing to retrieve user
  informations from her or his name.
- CHANGE: the values set to the '\Response' object from a controller action can
  now be retrieved thanks to the arrow operator (i.e '->').
  For example:
       $myResponse = new \Response();
       $myResponse->myValue = 'Hello';
       $myResponse->myOtherValue = $myResponse->myValue . ' world!';
- CHANGE: new 'setValues' method added to the ZnetDK form widget. This method
  initializes the data form as done by the 'init' method but the form is not
  reset. So existing data are preserved into the form.
- CHANGE: new 'General::writeSystemLog' method for tracking system events in the
  system.log file. The log file is defined into the config.php script through
  the new 'CFG_ZNETDK_SYSLOG' parameter.
- CHANGE: new "autoexecution" feature allowing to launch asynchronously
  an application controller action at periodical intervals. To enable this
  capability, a controller named 'autoexec' with a static method named 'main'
  have to be declared within the application or within a module. In addition,
  the CFG_AUTOEXEC_PHP_BINARY_PATH new parameter has to be customized according
  to the Operating System where the web application is deployed. The
  CFG_AUTOEXEC_FREQUENCY parameter allows you to fine tune the frequency for
  triggering the 'autoexec' action. Finally, the CFG_AUTOEXEC_LOG_ENABLED allows
  to track the 'autoexec' process when thrown by setting its value to TRUE.
- CHANGE: when the 'autoHeight' option is set to 'true' for the Dialog widget,
  now the dialog adjusts its height automatically when the viewport is resized,
  particularly when the orientation is changed on a tablet or mobile device.
- CHANGE: new 'data-zdkerrmsg-step' HTML5 attribute that can be added to an
  input HTML element of type 'number' to cutomize the error message to display
  when a 'stepMismatch' error is detected by the web browser on form data
  validation.
- BUG FIXING: when a JavaScript object is passed to the 'znetdk.request' method
  for the 'data' property, its string values are now encoded for replacing its
  special characters (i.e. / ? : @ & = + $ #) with their encoded version
  suitable for URI representation.
- BUG FIXING: when several inputs were declared into a ZnetDK form with the same
  HTML attribute 'name', the input shown in error on form validation was allways
  the first element of the form matching the 'name' attribute. Now, if for
  example the third input with the same 'name' no validates, it is correctly
  identified in error with a red frame around it.

ZnetDK 1.6, 2017-02-21
----------------------
- CHANGE: new 'data-zdk-delay' HTML5 attribute added both to the ZnetDK
  Actionbar and Autocomplete widgets to set the 'delay' option in milliseconds
  before sending the AJAX request to the server to get suggestions.
- CHANGE: the 'setAllowedActions' method can be declared in a ZnetDK application
  controller to restrict the execution of its actions according to the profile
  definition of the connected user. Within the 'setAllowedActions' method, the
  'AppController::setRequiredProfileForAction' parent method is called to set
  the user profile required by the connected user to execute the specified
  action. In addition, the 'AppController::setForbiddenProfileForAction' parent
  method can be called to set the profile that the connected user must not have
  to execute an action. Finally, the 'AppController::isActionAllowed' method can
  be called for example from a ZnetDK view, to add or not add an HTML button
  that matches a specific controller's action, according to the profile
  restrictions set through the 'setAllowedActions' method.
- CHANGE: new 'dataloaded' event triggered by the ZnetDK Tree widget after its
  data loading from the remote controller.
- CHANGE: the 'menu_id' column length of the 'zdk_profile_menus' table is
  extended to 50 characters. The new version 1.3 of SQL script named
  'znetdk-security-1.3.zip' can be downloaded from the official website page
  located at 'www.znetdk.fr/telechargements'.
- CHANGE: new 'LC_HEAD_ICO_LOGO' constant for specifying the image file to
  display as the 'favicon' of the application. If not set, the image indicated
  for the 'LC_HEAD_IMG_LOGO' constant is displayed instead.
- CHANGE: new 'Convert::toDecimalForDB' method to convert a number in string
  format to a formated number suitable for storage in the database.
- CHANGE: new 'UserManager::getUsersHavingProfile' method for retrieving the
  users having the specified profile name in parameter.
- CHANGE: new 'UserManager::hasUserMenuItem' method for checking if a user has
  access to the specified menu item.
- CHANGE: new '\Controller\Users::hasMenuItem' method for checking if the
  connected user has access to the specified menu item.
- CHANGE: the 'Security::loginResult' method is called each time a user try to
  connect to the application. This method can be defined in the application to
  track in a log the users connections informations.
- CHANGE: new HTML5 'data-zdk-cols-resize' attribute added to the ZnetDK
  Datatable widget. When set to 'true', the table columns are resizable.
- CHANGE: new HTML5 'data-zdk-multiselect' attribute added to the ZnetDK
  Datatable widget. When set to 'true', multiple table rows can be selected.
- CHANGE: a jQuery UI or Font Awesome icon can be added to the ZnetDK Datatable
  cells by setting the two new properties 'icon' and 'fieldValueTriggered'
  in the column definition. When the icon is clicked, the 'iconclick' event
  is triggered with the value matching the field entered for the
  'fieldValueTriggered' property.
- CHANGE: new 'autoHeight' option added to the Dialog widget. When set to true,
  the height of the dialog is adjusted to the browser window height. So, the
  dialog can be used for mobile applications.
- CHANGE: new 'aftershow' event sent by the GenericMenu widget once the view is
  displayed. In the event handler, the second parameter contains the displayed
  view name.
- CHANGE: new 'setCriteria' method added to the ZnetDK Autocomplete widget to
  set the criteria to send in AJAX to the PHP controller in order to limit the
  suggestions to the specified criteria.
- CHANGE: new 'empty' method added to the ZnetDK datatable widget to remove
  all the rows it contains.
- CHANGE: a third parameter named '$downloadedFilename' is added to the
 '\Response::setFileToDownload' method for specifying the name of the downloaded
 file. By default, the base name set for the $filepath parameter is used to name
 the downloaded file.
- CHANGE: new 'DAO::isForUpdate()' méthod added for checking if the 'FOR UPDATE'
  SQL CLAUSE is set for a DAO.
- CHANGE: tooltips and '...' ('ellipsis' in CSS) are now displayed on the user
  datatable for the following columns: 'user_name', 'user_email' and
  'user_profiles'.
- BUG FIXING: the focus was not automatically set on the 'textarea' widget when
  it was declared within a ZnetDK Dialog widget. Now, if a 'textarea' is the
  first visible and enabled input element into a dialog, the focus is set on it
  automatically after display of the dialog. The focus can also be forced to
  a textarea by adding the 'zdk-autofocus' CSS class to its HTML definition.
- BUG FIXING: when 'enable' and 'disable' methods are called for the ZnetDK
  Dropdown widget, the HTML 'disabled' property is accordingly set for the
  hidden HTML 'select' element. So, when the Dropdown widget is declared in a
  ZnetDK dialog, it is no longer automatically focused if it has been previously
  disabled.
- BUG FIXING: the message 'CORE - E_NOTICE - Undefined variable:
  doesPasswordChanged' was added to the 'errors.log' file when updating a user
  account without changing its password.
- BUG FIXING: the error message 'The profile 'profile name' already exists with
  the same name!' was displayed when trying to rename a user profile.
- BUG FIXING: the '\Convert::W3CtoLocaleDate' method returned the current date
  when an empty value was set as parameter. Now a NULL value is returned instead.
- BUG FIXING: when a radio button group is reset, the radio buttons within the
  group are now systematically enabled if they were previously disabled by a
  call to the 'disable' method of the 'puiradiobutton' widget. The 'disabled'
  property is not supported for the radiobutton widget (the widget must be
  explicitely disabled by JavaScript code.

ZnetDK 1.5, 2016-11-04
----------------------
- CHANGE: new config.php SQL parameter named 'CFG_SQL_TABLE_REPLACE_PREFIXES'
  for replacing default SQL table prefixes to new table prefixes (for example,
  to change the 'zdk_' and 'myapp_' prefixes to the 'new_' prefix, set the value
  serialize(array('zdk_'=>'new_', 'myapp_'=>'new_')) to the
  'CFG_SQL_TABLE_REPLACE_PREFIXES' parameter). So now, multiple ZnetDK
  applications can be hosted within a single MySQL database. The table prefixes
  are automatically replaced by those mentioned in the new config.php parameter
  while calling the 'DAO::store', 'DAO:remove', 'DAO:getResult', 'DAO:getById'
  and 'DAO::getCount' methods.
- CHANGE: when a network error occures while executing an AJAX request, a

  form, its value is now sent to the remote controller action with the rest of
  the form data. The button must be declared with the 'name' and 'value' HTML
  attributes.
- CHANGE: The validation error message displayed in a ZnetDK form is now hidden
  when the user changes the value of the input in error.
- CHANGE: the new 'ZDK_REDIRECT_APPL_UNKNOWN' parameter is added to the
  'globalconfig.php' configuration script. The HTTP request is now temporarily
  redirected to the URL set for this parameter when the 'default' application
  does not exist or when the application passed through the 'appl' or 'tool' url
  parameter does not exist.
- CHANGE: the widget theme now can be set dynamically by declaring in a ZnetDK
  application or module, a custom static public method named
  'Users::getUserTheme' in charge of returning the theme name to display.
- CHANGE: new '\Validator::setCheckingMissingValues' method for checking missing
  value by the derived validation methods.
- CHANGE: new '\Validator::setValues' method for setting values from an array.
  So, data other than the ones provided by an HTTP request can now be validated.
- CHANGE: the '\Validator::initOptionalVariables' method is no longer declared
  as abstract and then, its declaration becomes optional in any derived class.
- CHANGE: new 'getMessageWithoutCode' method added to the 'ZDKException' class
  to retrieve the exception message without the error code for a better user
  friendly display.
- CHANGE: new 'setCurrentDate' method added to the Inputdate widget to
  initialize its date field with the current date or the calculated date from
  the current date (i.e "+15d", "+2m", "+1y").

  So, multiple 'default' applications located on a same server machine can now
  be accessed from the same web browser without conflict.
- CHANGE: new 'suspend' method added to the autocomplete widget to disable the
  autocompletion mechanism.
- BUG FIXING: the default option value set through the 'data-zdk-value'
  attribute, was not selected for the ZnetDK Dropdown after a form reset.
- BUG FIXING: the ZnetDK modal dialog is now automatically closed only if the
  last submit button pressed has the 'zdk-close-dialog'.
- BUG FIXING: the '\Convert::toMoney' method returned zero when a null value
  was passed in parameter. By now, a null value is returned instead.
- BUG FIXING: the default form validation message displayed for the InputHtml
  widget when empty is now 'A value must be entered!' instead of 'A value must
  be selected!'.
- BUG FIXING: the asterisk character was not displayed for the Inputhtml widget
  label when the 'data-required' was set to 'true'.
- BUG FIXING: an HTTP GET 404 error was displayed in the web browser console
  while downloading the 'ui-icons_FFFFFF_256x240.png' resource of the 'z-w10'
  theme when enabled.

ZnetDK 1.4, 2016-08-17

  'refresh' or 'selectValue' method is called.
- CHANGE: the '\Convert::W3CtoLocaleDate' PHP method accepts a W3C date followed
  by a time with a 'HH:MI:SS' format. The time is now kept once the date is
  converted.

  initialization into the form before validating its data and sending them to
  the remote controller.
- CHANGE: new event 'disconnected' sent when the user is disconnected (click on
  the header 'Logout' link or the 'Cancel' button of the login dialog).
- BUG FIXING: the label elements declared in a ZnetDK form with the 'zdk-textvalue'

- BUG FIXING: the 'zdkform.getFormData()' method did not return the data of
  the empty and disabled input fields even if the 'getEmptyInputs' parameter was
  set to true.

ZnetDK 1.3, 2016-04-12
----------------------
- CHANGE: new 'focusOnYes' option added to the 'znetdk.getUserConfirmation()'
  method. When this option is set to true, the focus is given to the 'Yes'
  button. If not set or set to false, the focus is given to the 'No' button.
- CHANGE: the 'Action bar' and 'Datatable' widgets evolved:
  1) If a 'Modal dialog' contains a 'Datatable' widget, it is displayed after
  clicking on the 'Add' or 'Edit' button, only once the datatable rows are
  loaded.
  2) When double-clicking on a 'Datatable' row, its data are displayed in a
  modal dialog for edition, as if the user had clicked on the 'Edit' button.
  3) The row selected in the 'Datatable' remains selected after a data refresh
  when the row is modified or when the user clicks on the 'Refresh' button.
- CHANGE: the ZnetDK 'Datatable' widget can be declared with the 'tooltip'
  property set to true for the columns where cell content has to be displayed
  through a tooltip on mouse hover.

  that can be set to the new 'data-zdk-confirm' HTML attribute of the
  'Modal dialog' widget (see previous change description).
- CHANGE: the 'dataloaded' event is now triggered for the 'Listbox' widget once
  its items are loaded from a PHP controller action.
- CHANGE: the Javascript errors thrown while a view content is initialized, are
  now catched and an error message is displayed through the 'Notify' widget.
- BUG FIXING: the 'Dropdown' widget was not properly displayed when disabled.
- BUG FIXING: the 'enable' method of the 'Dropdown' widget is now executed only
  when the widget is disabled. So, the widget's events are no longer bound
  multiple times.
- BUG FIXING: the 'enable' method of the 'Checkbox' widget is now only performed
  when it is disabled. So, the widget events are no longer bound multiple times.
- BUG FIXING: the 'enable' and 'disable' methods of the 'Inputtext' widget are
  now only performed when the widget is disabled and enabled. So, the widget's
  events are no longer bound multiple times. In addition, the widget's events
  are now prefixed by the 'puiinputtext' namespace to avoid side effects when
  the widget is overloaded by another widget like the 'Inputdate' widget.
- BUG FIXING: the email address displayed when clicking on the login name from
  the banner, was not properly displayed for too long email addresses.

ZnetDK 1.22, 2016-03-26 (patch)
-------------------------------
- BUG FIXING: on some FastCGI virtualized hosting (for example on 1&1 hosting),
  the web resources of the application html page was not displayed, due to their
  incomplete relative path (the subdirectory path was missing after the domain
  name). See details of this issue on the ZnetDK forum.

ZnetDK 1.21, 2016-02-01 (patch)
-------------------------------
- BUG FIXING: ZnetDK fell into an infinite loop when it was deployed on some
  internet hosting server with FastCgi enabled: The PHP 'filter_input'
  statement applied to the '$_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD']' array returns 'false'
  instead of 'GET' or 'POST'.
- BUG FIXING: carriage return and line feed characters were removed from the
  POST parameters when read through the '\Request' object.

ZnetDK 1.2, 2016-01-22
----------------------
- CHANGE: new CSV export capability:
  1) The field separator ("," or ";") is set in the LC_LOCALE_CSV_SEPARATOR
  locale parameter.
  2) the 'Response::setDataForCsv()' method is called from the application
  controller to set the data to return as a CSV file.
- CHANGE: the DAO class evolves:
  1) New 'DAO::$amountColumns' property that can be set from the
  'DAO::initDaoProperties()' method to specify the columns that are to be
  displayed as an amount. For each of them, a formated amount is returned by the
  'DAO:getResult()' method in a new column named like the original column,
  excepted that it is suffixed by the '_amount' string (for example
  "mycol_amount" if the table column was originally named "mycol").
  2) New 'DAO::setSelectedColumns()' method: when called before the
  'DAO::getResult()' method, limits the values returned by the DAO to the only
  specified columns in parameters.
  3) The 'DAO::setSortCriteria()' method removes automatically the '_money',
  '_amount' and '_locale' suffixes into the sort clause string passed in
  parameter.
- CHANGE: new widget themes added to ZnetDK : 'asphalt' and 'greensea'.
- CHANGE: the 'zdkactionbar' widget evolved:
  1) The datatable rows are now filtered when the "Enter" key is pressed while
  the search field gets the focus.
  2) A new 'search' event is triggered when a keyword is submitted to filter the
  database rows and when the clear button of the search field is pressed. An
  event handler can then fully overload the standard search process (the call to
  the 'filterRows' method of the zdkdatatable) by returning the 'false'
  value.
  3) When a keyword is submitted through the search field, the entered keyword
  is automatically selected once the datatable rows is filtered.
  4) When the clear button of the search field is pressed, the keyboard focus is
  now automatically set to the search field.
- CHANGE: new 'Convert::valuesToAnsi()' method that can be called to convert a
  UTF-8 string to an ISO-8859-1 string.
- CHANGE: new 'zdk-autofocus' CSS class that can be added to an HTML element
  located into a 'puidialog' widget, in order to set the focus to this element
  when the dialog is shown.
- CHANGE: the 'zdkdatatable' widget by now also displays the warning messages
  returned by the application controller called to get the data rows. The
  controller returns a warning message when the 'Response::setWarningMessage()'
  method is invoked.
- CHANGE: the 'selectionchange' event is no longer triggered when the 'select'
  method of the 'puiradiobutton' widget is called. So, this event is only
  triggered when the radio button state is changed by a user action on the UI.
- CHANGE: new 'setFormModified' method added to the 'zdkform' widget and that
  can be call to force the state of the form data to modified or not modified.
- BUG FIXING: the Fontawesome icons was not displayed on IE11 when a ZnetDK
  application was deployed over the SSL protocol (the cache properties are now
  unset into the header response for the downloaded font files).
- BUG FIXING: the header's dropdown used for language selection was enlarged to
  display properly some larger language labels.
- BUG FIXING: the text of the question displayed when calling the
  'znetdk.getUserConfirmation()' method was not properly aligned.

ZnetDK 1.11, 2015-12-19 (patch)
-------------------------------
- CHANGE: the 'filterCriteria' option is now taken in account by the
  zdkdatatable widget when it is instantiated for the first time.

ZnetDK 1.1, 2015-12-08
----------------------
- CHANGE: in the step 3 of the Application Wizard, the new option
  "No, the access to a database is not required" allows to bypass the database
  configuration when the application doesn't need to access to a database.
- CHANGE: the Application Wizard creates now a new private directory named
  'documents', that is dedicated to the storage of the electronic documents
  uploaded and downloaded by the users. The path of this new directory can be
  known thanks to the new 'CFG_DOCUMENTS_DIR' PHP parameter.
- CHANGE: the conversion in JSON format of the response returned by a controller
  action is now forced, even if the response data is not properly encoded in
  UTF8. Nevertheless, if the conversion in JSON fails, an explicit HTTP error
  message is returned.
- CHANGE: new 'Users::notify' method that can be overloaded by the application
  to send an email notification to the user when her or his account has been
  created or when her or his password has been changed from the users manager
  view.
- CHANGE: the ZnetDK front controller accepts now HTTP requests sent with GET
  method when the specified controller action is named 'download'. By this way,
  files can be downloaded from a simple hyperlink added to a view or can be
  displayed inline in a view, through an HTML 'iframe'.
- CHANGE: new 'Response::setFileToDownload()' method which allows to specify
  from the 'download' controller action, the file returned by the web server
  for download.
- CHANGE: new 'Response::setPrinting()' method called from the 'download'
  controller action, for setting the FPDF printing returned by the web server.
- CHANGE: new 'General::getURIforDownload()' method allowing to get the URL of
  a document to download.
- CHANGE: the ZnetDK settings consistency controls are strengthened by
  displaying the HTTP error view with an error 500 when the
  'CFG_VIEW_PAGE_RELOAD' parameter is set to TRUE while:
  1) the 'CFG_AUTHENT_REQUIRED' parameter is also set to TRUE (not supported),
  2) the 'CFG_VIEW_PRELOAD' parameter is also set to TRUE (not consistent),
  3) the 'CFG_PAGE_LAYOUT' parameter is set to 'office' (not supported).
  In addition, an error is traced in the ZnetDK 'errors.log' file to specify the
  cause of the HTTP error.
- CHANGE:  the 'zdkdatatable' widget has evolved as specified below:
  1) When the paginator is enabled, the 'first' and 'rows' POST parameters are
  now systematically sent to the controller's action, even when the datatable is
  displayed for the first time. So, it's no longer necessary to test within the
  controller's action, whether the POST pagination parameters are defined or not
  (the pagination settings are done only one time into the view, through the
  'data-zdk-paginator' attribute).
  2) New method named 'selectRowByValue' that can be called to select a row from
  its value.
  3) The following attributes are now removed from DOM by the widget itself once
  it is initialized: 'data-zdk-columns', 'data-zdk-action', 'data-zdk-paginator'
  and 'title'.
- CHANGE: the 'DAO' class has 3 new properties that can be initialized from the
  'DAO:initDaoProperties()' abstract method:
  1) New 'DAO::$dateColumns' property to fill in for specifying the SQL columns
  of type 'Date' to format depending on the display language currently selected.
  2) New 'DAO::$tableAlias' property to fill in when an alias is used into the
  query for prefixing the main table of the DAO. This property is used by the
  'DAO::getById()' method to prefix the column containing the identifier of the
  row to select.
  3) New 'DAO::$groupByClause' property to fill in with the 'GROUP BY' clause of
  the SQL query. So, when the SQL query is executed applying custom filters, the
  'GROUP BY' clause can be added after the SQL conditions of the query.
- CHANGE: a warning icon is now displayed by the 'znetdk.getUserConfirmation()'
  confirmation dialog box.
- CHANGE: the 'znetdk.showMenuView()' method accepts a new 'options' parameter
  that is sent to the called view by the new 'initview' event.
- CHANGE: the derived version of the 'puidialog' widget has evolved as described
  below:
  1) The 'close' event is sent when the title bar close button is clicked on.
  2) The focus is set to radio buttons only when they are selected.
  3) The focus is also set to 'select' HTML elements.
  4) New method 'setTitle' allowing to set the dialog title dynamically.
- CHANGE:  the 'zdkmodal' dialog is now also closed automatically when the
  'zdk-close-dialog' CSS class is set to buttons declared with the 'zdk-bt-yes'
  or 'zdk-bt-no' CSS class.
- CHANGE: the 'zdkform' widget has evolved as described below:
  1) Values can now be displayed into the data form as a simple read only text,
  through a DIV element declared with the class 'zdk-textvalue' and the
  'data-name' attribute. So, when the 'init()' method of the 'zdkform' widget is
  called, the data matching the 'data-name' attribute is displayed into the DIV
  element.
  2) Only the HTML buttons which are direct children of the HTML form are grouped
  at the bottom of the form into the buttons pane. By this way, buttons declared
  into the form and surrounded for example by a DIV element, are not selected to
  be grouped into the form buttons pane.
  3) New 'isFormModified()' method that can be called to know whether the data
  of the form have been modified by the user.
- CHANGE: a new private property named '\Response::$viewCaller' has been added
  to identify the controller at the origin of the call of the view. This
  property can then be read by the view to customize its display, for example
  when the same view is used both to add and modify a business entity. In
  addition, the '\Response::setView' gets a new parameter named '$viewCaller' to
  specify a customized value for the '\Response::$viewCaller' property.
- CHANGE: new conversion methods added to the '\Convert' class:
  1) toMoney(): convert a decimal number to a money using locale settings,
  2) toLocaleDate(): convert a 'DateTime' object to a localized date,
  3) toW3CDate(): convert a 'DateTime' object to a W3C date,
  4) W3CtoLocaleDate(): convert a W3C date to a localized date.
- CHANGE: new constants added to the 'locale_fr.php', 'locale_en.php' and
  'locale_es.php' scripts for overloading the localization settings of the
  'setlocale()' PHP function. These new constants are LC_LOCALE_ALL,
  LC_LOCALE_DECIMAL_SEPARATOR, LC_LOCALE_THOUSANDS_SEPARATOR,
  LC_LOCALE_NUMBER_OF_DECIMALS, LC_LOCALE_CURRENCY_SYMBOL,
  LC_LOCALE_CURRENCY_SYMBOL_PRECEDE, LC_LOCALE_CURRENCY_SYMBOL_SEPARATE and
  LC_LOCALE_DATE_FORMAT.
- CHANGE: the FontAwesome icons are shipped with this version. The 'puimenu' and
  'puibutton' widgets now can be set both with jQueryUI and FontAwesome icons.
- BUG FIXING: after a call to the 'zdkform.reset()' method, the input focus
  could be set on hidden HTML input elements.
- BUG FIXING: when the 'CFG_VIEW_PAGE_RELOAD' parameter was set to TRUE, the
  hyperlink set for the banner logo and the 'httperror.php' view did not include
  the 'appl' GET parameter, while executing an application other than the
  'default' application.
- BUG FIXING: when the PEAR framework was specified in the 'include_path'
  parameter of the 'php.ini' file, the error "Notice: Use of undefined constant
  CFG_ZNETDK_ERRLOG" was displayed, due to the existing PEAR '\Config.php'
  script in conflict with the one named identically in the ZnetDK core.

ZnetDK 1.0 (stable version), 2015-09-23
---------------------------------------
- CHANGE: The ZDK_TOOLS_DISABLED parameter definition was moved from the
  'znetdk/.htaccess' file to the 'znetdk/applications/globalconfig.php' script,
  because the definition of a custom environment variable into the .htaccess
  file, through the 'Setenv' statement, is in most case not taken in
  account by the Internet Access Providers. TO ENSURE COMPATIBILITY WITH LEGACY
  APPLICATIONS developed in version 1.0 RC, set now the ZDK_TOOLS_DISABLED
  parameter as a PHP constant to the value TRUE into the
  'znetdk/applications/globalconfig.php' script if you want to disable the core
  tools access in a production environment.
- CHANGE: the 'classic' and 'office' page layouts were optimized for the display
  on tablet devices in portrait orientation (768 x 1024 pixels).
- CHANGE: the 'data-zdk-paginator' HTML5 attribute of the ZnetDK's 'Datatable'
  widget now can be used to define the number of buttons displayed for selecting
  a new page of rows (for example, data-zdk-paginator='50:10' will display 50
  rows per page and 10 page selection buttons on the paginator to select another
  page and display the matching rows).
- CHANGE: the widget 'AutoComplete' is now created with the 'autocomplete' HTML5
  attribute forced to 'off' to avoid conflicts with the autocompletion mechanism
  of the web browser.
- CHANGE: the background color of the message displayed with the 'Growl' PrimeUI
  widget fits now the severity of the message ('info', 'warn' or 'error').
- CHANGE: in the Application Wizard step 2, the themes displayed in the
  dropdown panel for selection are now sorted in ascending alphabetical order.
- BUG FIXING: on FireFox browser, the dropdown's selection panel was not
  properly aligned to its container when displaying images (the panel width was
  lower than the dropdown width).
- BUG FIXING: the main page of the application was loaded twice on FireFox (two
  HTTP GET requests received by the web server) because the HTML meta tag
  'charset' was not declared within the 1024 first characters of the page, due
  to HTML comments too long (see the comment 44 of the page
  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=236858 for details).
- BUG FIXING: the message 'CORE - E_NOTICE - Use of undefined constant question'
  was traced into the 'errors.log' file when trying to remove a user profile
  with associated data rows.
- BUG FIXING: the 'znetdk/applications/default/app/.htaccess' file was not
  generated by the Application Wizard.
- BUG FIXING: the 'classic' page layout was not properly displayed when the
  parameter CFG_VIEW_PAGE_RELOAD was set to TRUE.
- BUG FIXING: when the 'znetdk' widget theme was set, the hyperlinks displayed
  on the banner were not visible. In addition, an HTTP error 404 was traced in
  the Chrome web browser console for the 'ui-bg_flat_100_ff9400_4.png' image
  when ZnetDK was installed on Linux system.
- BUG FIXING: the 'DropDown' widget was not highlighted in red when no value
  was selected whereas it was set with the 'required' property (regression
  introduced in version 1.0RC).

ZnetDK 1.0 RC (Release Candidate), 2015-09-03
---------------------------------------------
- CHANGE: new application wizard for configuring and customizing the starter
  application (launched when typing 'http://myhostaddress/znetdk?tool=appwiz').
  The default application located in the '/znetdk/applications/default' directory
  is no longer delivered with ZnetDK.
- CHANGE: new 'ZDK_TOOLS_DISABLED' parameter in the root '.htaccess' file for
  disabling the application wizard when ZnetDK is deployed in production.
- CHANGE: multi-applications feature; several applications can be now deployed
  within a unique ZnetDK engine, in the '/znetdk/applications' directory, in
  addition to the 'default' application. Every other application can be accessed
  thru the GET parameter 'appl' (i.e '127.0.0.1/znetdk/index.php?appl=myappli'
  where 'myappli' is the sub-directory name of the application within the
  '/znetdk/applications/' directory).
- CHANGE: new widget 'zdkautocomplete' that is automatically instantiated when
  it is declared into a 'zdkform' and that can be directly connected to a ZnetDK
  controller action to retrieve the suggestions matching the keyword entered in
  the autocomplete field.
- CHANGE: new option 'defaultSelectedValue' and its associated HTML5 property
  'data-zdk-value' added to the 'zdkdropdown' widget for initializing a default
  value to select into the dropdown.
- CHANGE: new '\UserSession::removeCustomValue()' method allowing to remove
  from the user session a custom value initially added thru the
  '\UserSession::setCustomValue()' method.
- CHANGE: new file upload capabilities:
  1) new JavaScript widget 'zdkinputfile' that can be declared out of or into a
  ZnetDK entry form. It is based on the 'input' HTML element when its 'type'
  attribute is set to 'file'.
  2) new PHP methods 'isUploadedFile()', 'getUploadedFileInfos()' and
  'moveImageFile()' added to the \Request core class for getting informations
  about the last uploaded file and for moving it into its definitive location on
  the web server.
  3) the JavaScript 'znetdk.request' method can now upload a file to a controller
  action when the option 'fileToUpload' is specified.
- CHANGE: several AJAX requests now can be queued when user session has expired
  and are automatically replayed when the user credentials are renewed.
- CHANGE: the ZnetDK form includes the new features below:
  1) when the 'novalidate=""' HTML5 property is set for a ZnetDK form, the
  data of the widgets 'zdkdropdown' and 'zdkinputdate' are no longer validated.
  2) the text into an input field is automatically selected when it has the focus
  after an error has been detected.
  3) leading and trailing spaces are removed from the values returned by the
  'getFormData()' method.
- CHANGE: new data filtering feature allowing to limit the display of business
  table rows to those matching one or several user profiles (useful for Business
  workflow development):
  1) new method 'DAO::setStoredProfiles()' allowing to store one or more
  user profiles for the rows inserted or updated by the DAO.
  2) new method 'DAO::setProfileCriteria()' allowing to filter the rows
  returned by a DAO object to those matching one or more user profiles.
  3) warning message displayed when a profile is removed while business table
  rows are associated with.
  4) new core security table 'zdk-profile-rows' storing the business table rows
  associated to a profile.
- CHANGE: a user profile can't be longer created or modified if a profile with
  the same name already exists.
- CHANGE: the ZnetDK action bar widget evolves:
  1) The confirmation removal question can be customized for the selected row
  (new event 'whenremove' and new property 'getRemoveConfirm'.
  2) The simple declaration of an action button into the action bar with the
  style class 'zdk-bt-refresh', allows the datatable widget to be refreshed when
  this button is pressed.
- CHANGE: new CSS class 'zdk-bt-custom' allowing to instantiate automatically
  a 'puibutton' widget with custom icon, when declared for an HTML button within
  a ZnetDK form (widget 'zdkform'). The new HTML5 property 'data-zdk-icon' allows
  to specify the icon to display for the button.
- CHANGE: new method Validator::setErrorVariable() allowing to set the variable
  name in error from the checking method, if the variable in error is not the
  one matching the checking method where the error is detected.
- BUG FIXING: the 'checked' status of the radio buttons was wrongly reset for
  all the radio buttons instantiated for the application, even those not
  belonging to the radio button group for which the 'resetSelection' method was
  called.
- BUG FIXING: after a call to the 'resetSelection' method, the radio button
  originally declared in HTML with the 'checked' property was not selected by
  default. It was the same when the 'disabled' property was set.

ZnetDK 0.98 (beta version), 2015-07-21
--------------------------------------
- CHANGE: new 'zdkdropdown' widget based on the PrimeUI puidropdown, fully
  integrated to the ZnetDK form and directly connectable to any action
  of an application controller (see online demo at www.demo.znetdk.fr).
- CHANGE: the 'zdkradiobuttongroup' widget now simplifies the positioning of its
  radio buttons vertically and horizontally using the "br" HTML element to add
  a line break between two radio buttons (see online demo at www.demo.znetdk.fr).
- CHANGE: the 'reset' method of the 'zdkform' widget takes in account the HTML
  properties 'checked' and 'selected' by applying the default selection to the
  the radio buttons, listboxes and dropdown widgets.
- BUG FIXING: the displayed modal dialog is now removed when the user session
  has expired and the user clics on the 'Cancel' bouton from the connection
  dialog displayed for renewing his credentials.
- BUG FIXING: about the 'zdkform' widget, the focus is now systematically set to
  the field in error when the user submits the form several times.
- BUG FIXING: the 'zdkform' form is now properly initialized when its 'init'
  method is called whereas an error message is displayed into the form.
- BUG FIXING: on Internet explorer 11, when the 'classic' layout is set for the
  application (parameter CFG_PAGE_LAYOUT), the datatable rows are now properly
  highlighted when the mouse pointer hovers them and the selected row
  are now visible (see known issues pointed out in version 0.97).
- BUG FIXING: on Internet explorer 11, the radio buttons are now properly
  displayed (see known issues pointed out in version 0.97).
- BUG FIXING: on Internet explorer 11, the 'inputtext' and 'textarea' widgets
  were not properly reset after the triggering of the 'reset' event and the
  'required' HTML5 property was not taken in account after a new form HTML5
  validation.

ZnetDK 0.97 (beta version), 2015-07-10
--------------------------------------
- CHANGE: new widget 'zdkradiobuttongroup' which simplifies the declaration and
  the style definition of the radio buttons.
- CHANGE: the 'zdkform' widget evolves:
  1) It allows now to define custom error messages when the form validation fails
  thru the new HTML5 attributes 'data-zdkerrmsg-min', 'data-zdkerrmsg-max',
  'data-zdkerrmsg-pattern' and 'data-zdkerrmsg-date'.
  2) The 'reset' event sent to the form thru a button of type 'reset' is now
  catched by the form to reset its content.
  3) The date format is now directly validated by the form (input HTML element
  of type 'date').
  4) The 'listbox' and 'radio button' widgets are now easier to declare into the
  form (no need to wrap them with the DIV 'zdk-form-entry', see online demo on
  the ZnetDK website for detailed examples).
- CHANGE: the znetdk.initCommonWidgets() method instantiates the new
  'zdkradiobuttongroup' widget when the CSS style zdk-radiobuttongroup is
  declared for a DIV HTML element. In addition, the input HTML elements are also
  instantiated when their type attribute is 'url' and 'number'.
- CHANGE: new 'checkDate' public method added to the zdkinputdate widget to check
  the validity of the date typed in.
- CHANGE: new 'data-zdk-width' HTML5 attribute allowing to set directly in HTML
  a fixed width for the 'zdkmodal' dialog widget.
- CHANGE: JavaScript dedicated views for initializing (ie 'myview-ui-init.php')
  and managing events (ie 'myview-ui-events.php') can be defined now only one
  time when the base view is localized (ie 'myview_en.php', 'myview_es.php',...).
- CHANGE: new widget theme 'flat-two' made with the jQuery UI themeroller.
- BUG FIXING: the ZnetDK logo was not properly displayed when the '/applications
  /default' directory is absent. Consequently, the path of the heading logo
  picture defined for the LC_HEAD_IMG_LOGO constant into the '/applications/
  default/app/lang/locale_[lang].php' script, must start now from the
  installation root directory of ZnetDK. TO ENSURE COMPATIBILITY WITH LEGACY
  APPLICATIONS developed in a lower version than this version 0.97, the original
  value must be prefixed by the constant ZNETDK_APP_URI. For example:
  define('LC_HEAD_IMG_LOGO',ZNETDK_APP_URI . 'images/mylogo_en.png');
- BUG FIXING: the error message "Fatal error: Call to undefined method Locale::
  setApplicationLanguage() in ...." was displayed when the PHP extension
  'php_intl.dll' was enabled in the 'php.ini' file. the core class '\Locale' was
  moved into the '/engine/core/api' directory to avoid conflict with the PHP
  extension 'php_intl.dll' which also includes a class named '\Locale'.
- BUG FIXING: the E_NOTICE error 'undefined index: lang' is no longer raised and
  traced in the ZnetDK /engine/log/errors.log file when the user accesses to the
  application for the first time.
- BUG FIXING: a database table row was created twice when an addition form was
  submitted to the web server while the user session expired, after the user has
  typed in his credentials. By now, the session expiration is also checked by
  the object of type \Request.
- BUG FIXING: the datatable paginator was not properly displayed (only one page
  link was shown when several pages existed).
- KNOWN ISSUES: several issues are identified on this version for specific web
  browsers and are described below.
  a) Internet explorer 11 (version 11.0.9600.17843): when the 'classic' layout
  is set for the application (parameter CFG_PAGE_LAYOUT), the datatable rows are
  not highlighted when the mouse pointer hovers them and the selected row is not
  visible. Further more, whatever the layout choosen for the application, the
  button radios are not properly aligned.
  b) Chrome (version 43.0.2357.132 m): when a form containing an HTML fielset is
  submitted whereas a mandatory field is not filled in, an exception is triggered
  in the browser console with the error message "An invalid form control with
  name='' is not focusable.". See issue description in details on the website
  https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=498668 .
- TRANSLATIONS: the core Spanish translations configured into the script
  '/engine/core/lang/locale_es.php' are now more accurate (thank you José).
- REFACTORING: the widgets 'znetdkform' and 'znetdktable' are renamed to
 'zdkform' and to 'zdkdatatable'.

ZnetDK 0.96 (beta version), 2015-06-28
--------------------------------------
- New widgets zdklistbox that can be directly filled in with the data returned
  by a controller action.
- Correction of the \DAO::getCount() method which always returned the value 0
 (regression introduced in version 0.95).
- Method DAO::setMultipleFilterCriterias removed. The method DAO::setFilterCriteria
  is the one to use to define both one criterion or several criteria.
- The HTML 5 attributes 'data-errmess-required' and 'data-errmess-type'
  originally supported by zdkform are renamed 'data-zdkerrmsg-required' and
  'data-zdkerrmsg-type'.
- New 'zdk-row-id' style sheet class to be applied to the input field in the form
  which contains the row id currently edited. By now, the 'name' HTML attribute
  of the input field tagged with the class 'zdk-row-id', is read by the zdkactionbar
  widget to name identically the POST parameter sent to the controller action,
  when the user asks for removing a row in the datatable.
- The profile tree nodes displayed in the profile management form are again fully
  expanded when adding a new profile (regression introduced in version 0.95).
  When editing an existing profile, only the selected tree nodes are expanded
  while the others remain collapsed.

ZnetDK 0.95 (beta version), 2015-06-22
--------------------------------------
- The core class '\Menu' was renamed '\MenuManager' to avoid confusion with the
  application class \app\Menu. TO ENSURE COMPATIBILITY WITH LEGACY APPLICATIONS
  developed in a lower version than this version 0.95, the call to the
  "\Menu::addMenuItem" method must be replaced by a call to the
  new "\MenuManager::addMenuItem" method in the "menu.php" PHP script of your
  original ZnetDK application.
